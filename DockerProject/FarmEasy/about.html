   <h2>ABOUT</h2>
 <p>
 *It is a well known fact that many of our farmers are  poor. One of the many reasons for this is that they do not get the best price for their crop. And a reason for that is the presence of middlemen who take crops from farmers at low prices and sell them at high prices. Thus a farmer never gets a good price. 
<BR>
*In this view, a website could be designed that acts as a platform for the farmers to directly sell crops to consumers and thus get the best price. This is exactly what we decided to do. Our website, called FarmEasy, is a demonstration of this idea.

   <h2>DESIGN OF WEBSITE</h2>

*Our website has an interactive homepage which serves as the main introductory and essential page which offers useful features.<BR>
*A Farmer registration form has been provided in the homepage where he enters his personal details as well as the crops which he wishes to sell.<BR> 
*Besides this, the homepage also has several useful links for farmers.<BR>
*Useful photos of modern agriculture have been included.<BR>
*Videos of modern agriculture have also been included. These features help farmers to not only get themselves registered but also gain useful knowledge about agriculture.<BR>
